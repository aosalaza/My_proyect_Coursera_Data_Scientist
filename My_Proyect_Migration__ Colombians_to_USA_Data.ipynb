    "# DATA DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "### For this problem, we will get the services of Foursquare API to explore the data of two cities, in terms of their neighborhoods. The data also include the information about the places around each neighborhood. I selected one Borough from each city to analyze their neighborhoods. Orlando from Florida and Miami from Florida too.I will use machine learning technique, “Clustering” to segment the neighborhoods with similar objects on the basis of each neighborhood data. These objects will be given priority on the basis of foot traffic (activity) in their respective neighborhoods. This will help future residents choose which city is best for them to apply for their residency based on their own preferences and according to the characteristics defined in this project."
